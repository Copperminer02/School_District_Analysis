# School District Analysis

## Overview of School District Analysis

At the request of the state's Chief Data Scientist, I performed an initial  perfomance analysis on standardized reading and math scores for 9th -12th grade students.  Student performance was charted against school, school type, school size, and school spending.  These reults were compiled to create:

  - **The Entire District Summary**
  - **Results by school**
  - **Results by school and grade level**
  - **Scores by School Spending**
  - **Scores by School Size**
  - **Scores by School Type**
  
 Upon review of the initial analysis and due to speculation over inaccuracies in test scores; the analyis was ran again.  This second analysis mirrored the first, except the Thomas High School 9th grade test scores for math and reading were nulled out.  
 
 The topics below address the results of the initial analysis as well as the effects of removing the Thomas High School 9th grade test results.
 
 ## Results
 
- **District Summary:** The overall affect of the Thomas data is noticeable, but overwhelming.  The new analysis (hereinafter *Thomas Analysis*) shows mild decreases in % Passing Math (0.2%), % Passing Reading (0.1%), and Overall Passing (0.3%).

- **Summary by School:** As expected the only school data changed was for Thomas High School.  The *Thomas Analysis* shows decreases in Average Math Scores (0.13), Math Passing (0.09%) and Reading Passing (0.3%), as well as overall passing (0.3%).  In contrast, the Average Reading Score increased 0.05%.

  - ***Top Five Schools*** - Despite the potential error, Thomas still remains second overall on the list of top performing schools.  All other data remains the same.

  - ***Effect on Thomas High School Performance:*** Overall the nullification of Thomas' 9th grade scores did little to affect it's overall rating; however, the drop was enough for Griffin High School to surpass Thomas slightly in Average Math Score (0.001%) and % Passing Reading (0.1%).  Thomas is still clearly a top school, and any error's in the ninth grade data are fairly insignificant to the total validation of teh original analysis.

- **Analysis Comparisons: Effect of Thomas 9th Grade Change**
  - ***Math Scores by grade*** - Thomas 9th grade originally scored and average 83.6% on the math testing.  This is 0.1% higher then the next highest grades (11th and 12th 83.5%), and 0.2% high than the average for all other Thomas Grades.  Compared to other schools, Thomas 9th grade was second only to Holden (83.8%) and tied with Pena (83.6%) for best average math score.
